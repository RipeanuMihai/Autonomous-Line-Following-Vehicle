# Autonomous-Line-Following-Vehicle

Built an autonomous vehicle for the NXP Cup competition, capable of navigating a track by staying between two black lines. The system uses a FRDM-MCXN947 development board, a Pixy2 vision sensor for vector detection, DC motors and a servo motor for steering, all powered by a single battery. The project combines real-time image processing, motor control, and embedded programming, showcasing advanced skills in autonomous systems and robotics.
